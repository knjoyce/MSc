- all raw data (.csv and .sta files)
- final thesis document
- all figures in my thesis
- data frame (describing which experiment corresponds to each data file)
- python codes (importing, fft, peak finding, synthetic data, fwhm, curve fitting)
- jupyter notebooks
- scan of lab notebook 
- google slides document used to make figures (ie experiment setups)
- numerical results from thesis (see appendix)
- serial numbers of transducers (first page of lab notebook)
- table of which files were used in my thesis (and which figures they correspond to)
- latex source code for thesis
- transducer spec sheets
